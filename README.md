This repository hosts Jupyter Notebooks for introducing data wrangling with the 
pandas package in Python. The notebooks are based on lessons developed by 
[Bailie Wynbelt](https://github.com/BailieWynbelt).

There are two notebooks:

1. Data Wrangling with Python. This notebook contains all the code and output 
for the lesson. You can access the lesson using the MyBinder source by clicking 
the link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jcoliver/pybox/HEAD?labpath=Python-workshop.ipynb).
2. Blank notebook. This note book contains no code, but is provided as a "clean 
slate" where you can work through the lesson if you like. Access this blank 
notebook by clicking [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jcoliver/pybox/HEAD?labpath=Blank-notebook.ipynb).

The Data Wrangling in Python lesson is also available as a 
[downloadable PDF](https://github.com/jcoliver/pybox/blob/main/Data-wrangling-python.pdf).
